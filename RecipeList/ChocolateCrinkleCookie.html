            <p>Fair warning, this takes a long time to make because the dough needs to be cooled down completely. If it does not, you will not get a cookie, but more of a just a messy bar situation going for you.</p>
            <ol>
                <li> Whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, espresso powder, baking powder, salt and baking soda in a small bowl.</li>
                <li> Microwave the chocolate and butter in a medium microwave-safe bowl in 1-minute increments, stirring in between, until melted and smooth. Let cool slightly.</li>
                <li> Beat the brown sugar and eggs with an electric mixer on medium-high speed in a large bowl until thick, about 2 minutes. You really want to make sure that this mixture incorporates together to begin building the fluffiness of the cookie.</li>
                <li>Scrape the chocolate mixture into the egg mixture and beat until incorporated.</li>
                <li>Add the flour mixture and beat until just combined. Refrigerate the dough until firm, at least 2 hours and up to overnight. You REALLY want to make sure that this cools down completely before baking this. </li>
                <li>Position oven racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 350°F (180°C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
                <li>Put the powder sugar in a small bowl. Scoop out tablespoonfuls of the dough and roll them into balls. Refrigerate half the dough balls. Toss the remaining balls in the sugar, coating them very generously (you shouldn't see any dough peeking through). Arrange the balls about 1 inch apart on the prepared baking sheets.</li>
                <li>Bake until the cookies spread, the tops are dull in color and cracked and the edges are firm, 12 to 14 minutes. Let cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. When the baking sheets are cool, repeat with the remaining dough balls. The cookies can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days.</li>
