    <h1>Classic Chili</h1>
    <div>
        <p> I think after watching The Parent Trap one night I was craving chili. The funny thing is that I never was a person to think of wanting chili for lunch or dinner. This quickly became a favorite to make when the weather became cooler! Pair it with cornbread and sheesh.</p>
        <p>Luckily, I had seached online and found this recipe that I loved making. You can find the original recipe by <a href="https://www.thewholesomedish.com/the-best-classic-chili/" target="_blank">clicking here</a> to see the amazing photo guide that Amanda made.</p>

            <p>This is honestly ones of the easiest things to make. The hardest thing would really be buying the ingredients. From that, you really are going to just toss everything together after cooking the beef for a bit.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Add the olive oil to a large soup pot and place it over medium-high heat for two minutes. Add the onion. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
                <li>Add the ground beef to the pot. Break it apart with a wooden spoon. Cook for 6-7 minutes, until the beef is browned, stirring occasionally.</li>
                <li>Add the chili powder, cumin, sugar, tomato paste, garlic powder, salt, pepper, and optional cayenne. Stir until well combined.</li>
                <li>Add the broth, diced tomatoes (with their juice), drained beans, and tomato sauce. Stir well.</li>
                <li>Bring the liquid to a low boil. Then, reduce the heat (low to medium-low) to gently simmer the chili, uncovered, for 20-25 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
                <li>Remove the pot from the heat. Let the chili rest for 5-10 minutes before serving.</li>
