    <h1>Baked Chicken Tenders</h1>
    <div>
        <p>I admit that I am pretty much a child at heart. Admittedly, that also means that if I am at Red Robin there is an almost 50% chance I am getting chicken tenders there. When I am in the mood to have chicken tenders at home, aka not feeling lazy, I will make these.</p>
        <br>
        <div id="ThingsToBuy">
            <p>Here are the things that you will need to go and buy.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>⅓ cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>2 large eggs</li>
                <li>1⅓ cups panko breadcrumbs</li>
                <li>⅔ cup of finely shredded parmesean cheese</li>
                <li>1 tsp Italian seasoning</li>
                <li>1 tsp paprika</li>
                <li>1 tsp garlic powder</li>
                <li>1½ Tbsp olive oil</li>
                <li>2 lbs. chicken tenders</li>
                <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
                <li>1 Tbsp minced fresh parsley</li>
            </ul>

            <li>Preheat your oven to 425˚F.</li>
            <li>Prepare your dredging ingredients. Pour flour into a small shallow dish. In another dish, crack and wisk your eggs.</li>
            <li>In a third dish, toss together the breadcrumbs, parmesan cheese, Italian seasoning, paprika, and garlic powder. Drizzle that with olive oil and toss well to evenly coat.</li>
            <li>Season both sides of the chicken tenders with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>You are going to dredge the chicken pieces first in flour, then egg, then the breadcrumbs. Just keep one hand solely for dry ingredients and then the other for the wet egg part. Over time, you will get better and keeping your dredge area clean. Part of the fun in first learning how to cook is learning all the tips and tricks.</li>
            <li>Transfer the chicken pieces to a cooking sprayed wire rack and place on a baking sheet. </li>
            <li>Bake in your oven until your chicken comes to temperature. That is 165˚F in the center, which is about 15-20 minutes.</li>
            <li>If wanted you can garnish these with parsley and serve with the dipping sauce of choice.</li>
        </ol>
