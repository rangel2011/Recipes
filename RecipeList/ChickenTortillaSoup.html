    <h1>Chicken Torilla Soup</h1>
    <div>
        <p>I have had my InstaPot for years, but really did not use it much. While we were at our friend Ronni's house, we were watching her make dinner and she was using her InstaPot. We watched how quickly she made this recipe, using frozen chicken too! Manny and I bought the cookbook quickly after that, and now this is one of my go-tos when I have no clue what to meal prep. Shout out to Brittany William's Instant Loss Cookbook! The original recipe can be found in that book!</p>

        <div id="ThingsToBuy">
            <p>Here are the things that you will need to go and buy. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> 2(6 to 8 ounces) chicken breasts</li>
                    <li> 2 cups cooked black beans (we just use canned) </li>
                    <li> 1 can of corn kernals </li>
                    <li> 5 garlic cloves (let's be real, you can add as much as you like, there is no such thing as too much garlic) </li>
                    <li> 1 large white onion, diced </li>
                    <li> 1 red bell pepper, diced </li>
                    <li> 6 ounces of tomato paste </li>
                    <li> 4 cups of chicken broth </li>
                    <li> ¼ cup of diced pickled jalapenos with juice (you can totally add more depending on how <em>spicy</em> you like it) </li>
                    <li> ¼ of taco seasoning (if you have a Costco membership, they sell it there and it is way cheaper) </li>
                    <li> A bag of torilla chips, you can also make your own but this is supposed to be an easy InstaPot recipe </li>
                </ul>

            <p>Onto the actual steps of the recipe. Honestly, one of my favorite things about this one is how EASY it is to make. </p>
            <ol>
                <li> Put all of the ingredients into your InstaPot, we put the chicken down first. Honestly, that is just out of habit though.</li>
                <li> Then you are going to make sure that your pressure cooker is on SEALING and you are going to put it on 15 minutes if you are using frozen chicken breats. If you are using fresh chicken breasts, which we thing tastes better, you are going to put it on 8 minutes. </li>
                <li> When the cooker is done, you are going to switch your pressure cooker to the VENT setting. Be careful with this step! That steam is hot.</li>
                <li> Remove the lid and shred the chicken. You can use two forks to do this. If you have a hand mixer, you can also use that to shred your chicken, but does anyoe really want to have something else to clean up too?</li>
            </ol>
            <p> Then go ahead and you can add however many tortilla chips that you like! You can also add in cheese, avocado slices, fresh cilantro, the possiblities are endless!
