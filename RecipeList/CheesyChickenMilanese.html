    <h1>Cheesy Chicken Milanese</h1>
    <div>
        <p>This was the other dish that we made the first time that we made dinner together. That night Manny also invited some friends over and it was the first time that I got to see into his life. This meal has become a favorite memory of mine, and it is also pretty easy to make!</p>

            <p> Okay, not going to lie, I hate making these! The things to buy are from the original recipe, but Manny and I have made tweaks that we like better. Some of the things we ended up not liking and then sometimes ya boy is lazy and I skip a step. Within the directions, I will note what we do different.</p>
            <ol>
                <li> Preheat oven to 325°. Place 1 chicken breast between 2 big sheets of plastic wrap. Using the smooth side of a meat pounder or an empty wine bottle, pound chicken as thin as you can without ripping it to shreds. Season with salt, black pepper, and cayenne. Repeat with remaining chicken breasts. (Nothing different here though! Season your chicken though folks!) </li>
                <li> Set up 3 shallow bowls. Spread out 1 cup flour in one; season liberally with salt, black pepper, and cayenne. Place eggs in second bowl; season with salt and beat lightly just to combine. Combine breadcrumbs and panko in third bowl; season with salt and black pepper. (There is nothing different that we do here either.) </li>
                <li> Place ¼ cup mozzarella on one side of each pounded chicken breast, about 2" in from the edges. Moisten edges of whole breast with water, then sprinkle a little flour all over the edges. Fold breast over cheese, pressing on edges to seal. (Okay, if you do not have time to smash your chicken breast, you can just cut into the breast half way and shove cheese into the chicke that way. We find it saves us time.) </li>
                <li> Dip chicken into seasoned flour on both sides, shaking off excess. Dip into egg on both sides, letting excess drip off. Press each side into breadcrumbs. Transfer chicken to a plate. Repeat with remaining chicken. (We like to repeat the process a second time with the chicken breast pieces for a crunchier breading.) </li>
                <li> Pour canola oil into a large skillet to a depth of about ½". Heat over medium-high until oil is hot. Carefully lay 2 breaded cutlets in skillet and cook until browned and crisp, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip cutlets and cook until golden brown, another 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer cutlets to a rimmed baking sheet and bake in oven until deep golden brown, about 15 minutes. (Be careful with this step y'all.)
                </li>
                <li> Meanwhile, fry remaining cutlets, adding a little oil if necessary between batches. </li>
                <li> Arrange cutlets on plates. Top with arugula and tomatoes. Using a vegetable peeler, shave some Parm over each cutlet; season with salt and black pepper. Drizzle with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. </li>
            </ol>
