    <h1>Snowball Cookies</h1>
    <div>
        <p>One time my friend Jasmine came over and she wanted to bake. I will be completely honest, she was horrible at baking during that time LOL. So, I went to find one of the easiest cookie recipes that I could find! Luckily, these also happened to be one of my favorite childhood cookies that I forgot about, until I made and devoured like 12 of them.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Here is a video that shows me baking the cookies. </p>

            <p>Here are the things that you will need to go and buy. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 cups of flour</li>
                    <li>½ cup nuts</li>
                    <li>1 cup of butter</li>
                    <li>½ powdered sugar</li>
                </ul>

            <p>Before beginning though, can we just look at that ingredient list! This recipe is super simple to make! The 1/2 cups of nuts can be omitted or even subsituted for nuts that you prefer. You can also use salted or unsalted butter depending on what you want, or even use coconut oil too. I prefer to use unsalted butter and I can not promise anything else using the other options. </p>
            <ol>
                <li> Preheat your oven to 325°F </li>
                <li> First, get your butter and combine that with your powdered sugar. The two will come together to make a cream consistency. </li>
                <li> Combine the flour and nuts with your sugar butter mixture. </li>
                <li> Scoop out the mixture into cookie sizes that you prefer. Usually, I keep mine between 1 to 1.5 inches in diamter. </li>
                <li>Place them on your baking tray. (You can keep them near each other because they do not expand while baking). </li>
                <li> Bake for 20-25 minutes. </li>
                <li> Remove them from the oven and then roll them in more powdered sugar! </li>
                <li>Cool completely before serving and enjoy! </li>
            </ol>
